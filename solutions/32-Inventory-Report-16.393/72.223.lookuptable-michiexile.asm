-- HUMAN RESOURCE MACHINE PROGRAM --
-- 32-Inventory-Report - SIZE 72/16 - SPEED 233/393 --

-- so this one runs QUICKLY (223 steps vs. expected 393)
-- but it is LONG (partially b/c no numeric literals; could probably done it slightly quicker) with 72 instructions vs. expected 16.
-- floor registers are used as:
-- 15: count of A
-- 16: count of B
-- 17: count of C
-- 18: count of X
-- 1: reference copy of A
-- 2: reference copy of X
-- 3: reference copy of B
-- 4: reference copy of C
-- 14: current floor tile reference
-- 13: end of populated floor tiles
-- 19: current query reference (because mixed arithmetic is forbidden)
-- I specifically add the right counter to handle the count when blanking out tile 13 to use as a register
-- I could probably do this without blanking 13, by reusing 19, I think
